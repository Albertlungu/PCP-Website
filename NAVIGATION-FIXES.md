# Navigation Fixes - Complete ‚úÖ

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Navigation Bar Width
**Problem:** Navigation bar was too narrow (96% width, 1500px max) and didn't stretch to accommodate all menu items, causing some tabs to overflow.

**Solution:** 
- Increased width from `min(96%, 1500px)` to `min(98%, 1800px)`
- Added explicit `max-width: 1800px` for better control
- Reduced gap between menu items from `1.2rem` to `0.8rem` for tighter spacing

**Files Modified:** 
- `styles.css` - Lines with `.navbar` and `.nav-menu`

### 2. Missing Navigation Links on All Pages
**Problem:** The "Calendar" and "Sign Up" links only appeared on index.html but were missing from all other pages (description.html, schedule.html, chamber-music.html, masterclasses.html, performance-class.html, code-of-conduct.html, our-students.html).

**Solution:** 
Updated the navigation menu in ALL HTML files to include:
```html
<li><a href="signup.html">Sign Up</a></li>
<li><a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a></li>
```

**Files Modified:**
- description.html
- schedule.html  
- chamber-music.html
- masterclasses.html
- performance-class.html
- code-of-conduct.html
- our-students.html

(index.html, calendar.html, and signup.html already had the correct navigation)

## Current Navigation Order
