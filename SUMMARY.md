## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### CRITICAL: Set Up Google Integration

The website is ready to use, but you need to complete ONE of these setup options:

#### **Option 1: Google Apps Script (Recommended - Easiest)**

This allows the signup form to write directly to your spreadsheet.

1. Open your spreadsheet
2. Go to Extensions → Apps Script
3. Paste the code from `SETUP.md` (the script I provided)
4. Deploy as Web App
5. Copy the URL and paste it in `signup.js` where it says `YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE`

**Time required: 5-10 minutes**

#### **Option 2: Google Sheets API**

For reading calendar data dynamically (currently using hardcoded data).

1. Get an API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Enable Google Sheets API
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in `calendar.js`
4. Make your spreadsheet publicly viewable

**Time required: 10-15 minutes**

### Current Status

✅ **Working Now (no setup needed):**
- Homepage
- All existing pages
- Calendar displays events (using embedded data from your spreadsheet)
- Signup form UI and validation

⚠️ **Needs Setup:**
- Signup form submissions to Google Sheets (need Google Apps Script URL)
- Dynamic calendar updates (currently uses snapshot of your data)

## 📊 How It Reads Your Spreadsheet

The calendar intelligently interprets your spreadsheet:
- **Date column**: Parses dates like "Sept 13", "Oct 4"
- **Guest Artist**: Shows who's leading the class
- **Multiple performers**: Groups performers on the same date
- **Event types**: Auto-detects Masterclasses, Performance Classes, and Special Events based on the "Remarks" column

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

I kept your existing theme but enhanced it:
- **Same color palette**: Burgundy (#6d0a2e) and Gold (#d4af37)
- **Same glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects with blur
- **Same animations**: Floating music notes, ripple effects
- **Enhanced forms**: Better input styling, clearer feedback
- **Professional calendar**: Clean, easy-to-read layout

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

Everything works beautifully on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

The calendar adapts to smaller screens, and the signup form stacks vertically on mobile.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- No sensitive data exposed in the code
- Service account email keeps your personal email private
- Submissions go directly to your controlled spreadsheet

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Upload all files** to your web server
2. **Set up Google Apps Script** (5 minutes - see SETUP.md)
3. **Test the signup form** with a dummy submission
4. **Share the calendar link** with students!

## 📁 New Files Created

1. `calendar.html` - Calendar page
2. `signup.html` - Signup form page
3. `calendar.js` - Calendar functionality
4. `signup.js` - Signup form handling
5. `styles-calendar-signup.css` - All new styles
6. `SETUP.md` - Detailed setup instructions
7. `SUMMARY.md` - This file
