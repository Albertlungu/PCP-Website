### Key Features
- Visual admin interface at `/admin`
- Add/edit/delete student profiles
- Upload student photos
- Control display order
- Changes commit directly to GitHub
- Vercel auto-deploys changes
- Zero coding required for edits

## How It Works

### For You (Admin)
1. Visit `yoursite.com/admin`
2. Log in with GitHub
3. Click "Students" → "New Student"
4. Fill in name, description, upload photo, set order
5. Click "Publish"
6. Wait 1-2 minutes
7. Changes appear on live site

### Behind the Scenes
1. Decap CMS creates/edits markdown file in `/_data/students/`
2. Changes commit to GitHub repo
3. GitHub triggers Vercel webhook
4. Vercel rebuilds and deploys site
5. `students-loader.js` fetches updated files
6. Students render on `/our-students.html`

### File Format
```markdown
---
name: "John Doe"
description: "Violinist with 5 years of experience in chamber music."
image: "/images/students/john-doe.jpg"
order: 1
---
```

---

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### 1. Commit to GitHub ✓ Next Step
```bash
cd ~/Documents/PCP-Website
git add .
git commit -m "Add Decap CMS admin system for student profiles"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Set Up Authentication (Choose One)

**Option A: Netlify (Recommended)**
- Deploy to Netlify (5 minutes)
- Enable Identity + Git Gateway
- Use Netlify URL for admin: `yoursite.netlify.app/admin`
- Keep Vercel for public site
- Cost: $0

**Option B: GitHub OAuth + Vercel**
- Create GitHub OAuth App (15-30 minutes)
- Configure Decap CMS
- Use Vercel URL for admin: `yoursite.vercel.app/admin`
- More complex setup
- Cost: $0

### 3. Test Admin Interface
- Visit `/admin`
- Log in
- Add/edit sample student
- Verify changes appear on site

### 4. Clean Up
- Delete old `js/admin.js` (localStorage version)
- Delete `admin.html` in root (old admin page)
- Remove sample student or replace with real student

---

## Technical Details

### Authentication
- Uses GitHub OAuth
- Commits are made by authenticated user
- Each edit creates a Git commit
- Full version history maintained

### Data Storage
- Markdown files in `/_data/students/`
- Images in `/images/students/`
- Everything version-controlled in Git
- No database needed

### Performance
- Static site generation (fast)
- Images served from Vercel CDN
- JavaScript lazy-loads on page visit
- Minimal API calls (GitHub API once per page load)

### Scalability
- Handles hundreds of students easily
- GitHub API rate limit: 60 requests/hour (unauthenticated)
- Can upgrade to authenticated API if needed
- Vercel free tier: 100 deployments/month (you use ~15)

---

## Cost Analysis

### Current Setup
- Vercel: Free (100 builds/month, you use ~15)
- Decap CMS: Free (open source)
- GitHub: Free (public repo)
- **Total: $0/month**

### If Using Netlify for Auth
- Netlify: Free (basic plan)
- Identity: Free (1,000 users)
- Git Gateway: Free (included)
- **Total: $0/month**

## Success Criteria

The system is working correctly when:
1. ✓ All files exist in repo
2. ✓ Files committed and pushed to GitHub
3. ⏳ Can access `/admin` (after auth setup)
4. ⏳ Can log in with GitHub (after auth setup)
5. ⏳ Can add/edit/delete students visually
6. ⏳ Changes appear on live site after 1-2 minutes
7. ⏳ Images upload and display correctly

## Comparison: Old vs New System

| Feature | Old System (localStorage) | New System (Decap CMS) |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Data persistence | Browser only | GitHub (permanent) |
| Access | One computer | Any device |
| Backup | None | Git history |
| Collaboration | Impossible | Multiple admins possible |
| Version control | None | Full Git history |
| Image management | None | Built-in uploader |
| Security | Password in code | GitHub OAuth |
| Maintenance | Manual code edits | Visual interface |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify files exist** (run checklist)
2. **Commit to GitHub** (3 commands)
3. **Choose authentication method** (A or B)
4. **Follow setup guide** (DECAP_CMS_SETUP.md)
5. **Test admin interface**
6. **Add first real student**

---

## Questions to Consider

1. **Which authentication method do you prefer?**
   - Netlify (easier, recommended)
   - GitHub OAuth (more control, harder)

2. **Do you want to keep the sample student?**
   - Yes (as a template)
   - No (delete it)

3. **Do you need help with the Git commands?**
   - Yes (I can walk you through)
   - No (I can commit myself)

## Contact Points

If something breaks, check:
1. Browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
2. GitHub Actions tab for build failures
3. Vercel deployment logs for deploy errors
4. `DECAP_CMS_SETUP.md` troubleshooting section
